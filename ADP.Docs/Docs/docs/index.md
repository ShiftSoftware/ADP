# Auto Distributor Platform (ADP)
Dealers operating under a large auto distributor typically use stand-alone Dealership Management Systems (DMS) to manage their business operations.  

The lack of integration between the DMS systems of the dealers and the distributor's systems causes significant inefficiencies and operational challenges.  

There is a strong need for a centralized platform that provides seamless integration between the distributor, its dealers, and customers.

The ADP is a set of seamlessly integrated software tools designed to streamline the operations of the distributor and its dealers.

## ADP Hub (Portal)
The ADP Hub is a web-based portal that provides a single point of access to the various tools and services offered by the ADP.  
In addition to links to the Core ADP Components, the Hub provides the following features:

1. News & Other Announcements from the Distributor
2. Policies
3. Repair Manuals
4. File Sharing System between dealers and the distributor

## Core Components of ADP
The ADP consists of the following core components distributed as microservices:

- [Identity System 	↗](components/identity.md)
- [Vehicle Database 	↗](components/vehicles.md)
- [Parts Database 	↗](components/parts.md)
