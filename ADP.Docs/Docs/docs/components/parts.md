# Parts Database
The parts database provides the following features:

- Genuine Manufacturer Part Information.
- Part availability at the Distributor Level.
- Deadstock part availability at the Dealer Level.

## Manufacturer Parts
The manufacturer provides a large dataset containing all genuine part information. Dealers and the distributor can benefit from this for various purposes.
The distributor compiles the parts from the manufacturer and may provide additional information such as pricing details (Cost Price, Retail Price, Warranty Price, etc.).

## Third-Party Parts
The distributor may also provide third-party parts. These parts follow the same structure as the genuine parts but are not provided by the manufacturer. 

## Distributor Part Availability
Dealers can look up part numbers and check their availability from the distributor.

## Dealer Deadstock 
Dealers can share their deadstock, making these parts available to other dealers and the distributor during a part lookup. 

!!! note
    The Part Lookup feature combines data from all four sources and presents them to the user while searching for a part.

## Part Information
Parts are identified by a unique Part Number. Detailed information about a part is available in the [integration document](/integrations/parts.html).
