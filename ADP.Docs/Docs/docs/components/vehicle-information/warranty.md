## Standard Warranty

Almost all authorized vehicles come with a standard warranty that is usually activated from the date of sale to the end customer (Invoice Date).

!!! note
	The Warranty Activation depends on the **End Customer's** Invoice Date.
	This should not to be confused with any of the following or other invoice dates of a vehicle:    
		<ul>
			<li>**Manufacturer to Distributor** Invoice Date.</li>
			<li>**Distributor to Dealer** Invoice Date.</li>
			<li>**Dealer To Sub-Dealer or Other Dealer** Invoice Date.</li>
			<li>**Dealer (Or Sub-Dealer) to 3rd Party Partners (Brokers)** Inovice Date.</li>
		</ul>

    Additionally, there are cases where the warranty activation date does not exactly match the invoice date. For example, there may be a delay in delivering the vehcile to the end customer.

## Extended Warranty
Customers have the option to extend their warranty by buying extended warranty packages.
