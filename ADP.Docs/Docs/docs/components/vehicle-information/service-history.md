Services performed on a vehicle at any authorized dealer are recorded in the dealer's **DMS** (Dealer Management System).   

Common **Services** include, but are not limited to:

- Periodic Maintenance
- Checkups and General Repairs

Since data from all dealers are synchronized to the centralized Data Warehouse, the service history of a vehicle is available in the Vehicle Lookup Feature.
