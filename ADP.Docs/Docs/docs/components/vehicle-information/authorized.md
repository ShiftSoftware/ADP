## Authorized & Unauthorized Cars

A car is considered **"Authorized"** or **"Official"** if it is imported by the official distributor for a specific geographic region.

In contrast, cars not imported by the official distributor are considered **"Unauthorized"**, **"Unofficial"**, or **"Grey Imports"**.
